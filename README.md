# Multiple Disease Prediction System 
A web application for predicting multiple diseases using machine learning models. This project includes prediction models for diabetes, Canser disease, heart disease, and breast cancer.
# Models
The machine learning models used in this web app are trained on publicly available datasets specific to each disease. Here is a brief description of each model:

Diabetes Model: This model predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

Heart Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features of a person.

Breast Cancer Model: This model predicts whether a breast mass is malignant or benign using features derived from breast cytology.
